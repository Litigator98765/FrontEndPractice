# Mario Website
The goal of this project was to become more familiar with HTML and CSS to create a professional looking webpage from scratch. This project was successful as I am now familiar with a variety of HTML tags, as well as many of CSS statements to create a good looking webpage. I am excited to apply the new things that I have learned into a more in depth project in the future. I plan on using these skills to create some kind of webpage that uses spotify API calls to show users interesting data about their listening habits. More on this soon!
